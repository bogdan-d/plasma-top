"""Runtime file locations, shared by the daemon, the `page` command and the applet.

Everything the daemon publishes for the widget lives under one per-user runtime
directory on tmpfs. The layout is not cosmetic — the applet drives its reads off
an inotify watch on the HTML directory (a FolderListModel), so that directory
must churn only when there is something new to show:

    <runtime>/            <- watched: the two HTML files, nothing else
        panel.html
        tooltip.html
        state/            <- not watched: page counter, geometry, lock
            geom
            page
            npages
            page.lock

The state files change on every wheel notch and every panel resize; keeping them
in a sibling means those writes never wake the watcher. The atomic-write tmp
files (`panel.tmp`) do land in the watched directory — a rename-over has to stay
on the same filesystem — but the applet's nameFilters keep them out of its model
and its debounce collapses the extra notification.

Kept stdlib-only and import-cheap: `pagestate` imports it, and that module is on
the `pirostats page next` path, fired once per mouse-wheel notch.
